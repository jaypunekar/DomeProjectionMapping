## What is Dome Projection Mapping?
Dome projection mapping is a technique that involves projecting visual content, such as images or videos, onto the curved surface of a dome. This allows for the transformation of the dome's appearance by creating dynamic and immersive visual experiences. The content is carefully aligned and adjusted to fit the dome's unique shape, resulting in stunning visual displays that can envelop the audience and create captivating environments.
